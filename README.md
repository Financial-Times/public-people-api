Based on the following [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SC4Uskl-VD78y0lg5H2Gq56VCmM4OFHofZM-OvpsOFo/edit#heading=h.qjo76xuvpj83).


Health Checks
-------------

Health checks: [http://localhost:8080/__health](http://localhost:8080/__health)


### Logging

* The application uses [logrus](https://github.com/Sirupsen/logrus); the log file is initialised in [app.go](app.go).
* Logging requires an `env` app parameter, for all environments other than `local` logs are written to file.
* When running locally, logs are written to console. If you want to log locally to file, you need to pass in an env parameter that is != `local`.
* NOTE: `/build-info` and `/__gtg` endpoints are not logged as they are called every second from varnish/vulcand and this information is not needed in logs/splunk.
